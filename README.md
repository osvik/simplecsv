# Simplecsv

The **Go** package **simplecsv** is a simple mini-library to handle **csv** files. I'm building it to help me writing small command line scripts. Maybe it's useful to someone else as well.

**Some notes:**

* all **read** methods return the value in the csv and a second true/false value that is true if the value exists
* all **write** methods that change the csv return the changed csv and a true/false value if the operation was sucessful
* all cells are **strings**

## Examples

### Csv file

Simplecsv works with comma separated csv files.

#### Read

Reads file and parses as a SimpleCsv object. `fileRead` is false if there's an error reading the file or parsing the CSV.

```go
var x simplecsv.SimpleCsv
var fileRead bool
x, fileRead = simplecsv.ReadCsvFile("my1file.csv")
```

#### Create

Create empty file and define cssv headers:

```go
var u simplecsv.SimpleCsv
u = simplecsv.CreateEmpyCsv([]string{"Age", "Gender", "ID"})
```

#### Write

Write the SimpleCsv object to my2file.csv. If there's an error, `wasWritten` is false.

```go
wasWritten := u.WriteCsvFile("my2file.csv")
```

### Headers

The cells of the first row are considered headers.

#### Get

Get all headers:

```go
headers := x.GetHeaders()
```

Get header at position one (second position as it starts from 0):

```go
headerName, headerExists := x.GetHeader(1)
```

Get header position: (it returns `-1` if the header does not exist)

```go
position := x.GetHeaderPosition("Gender")
```

#### Rename

Rename header: (old header, new header)

```go
x, headerExists := x.RenameHeader("ID", "IDnumber")
```

`headerExists` is false if the old header does not exist.

### Rows

#### Get

Get number of rows:

```go
numberOfRows := x.GetNumberRows()
```

Get second row:

```go
row, rowExists := x.GetRow(1)
```

Get second row as a map:

```go
row, rowExists := x.GetRowAsMap(1)
```

#### Add

Add a **slice** to a row. The slice must have the same size as the CSV number of columns. If not wasSucessful is false.

```go
var wasSucessful bool
x, wasSucessful = x.AddRow([]string{"24", "M", "2986732"})
```

Add row from **map**: (If the map keys don't exist as columns, the value will be discarded. If a key does not exist, it will create empty cells.)

```go
mymap := make(map[string]string)
mymap["Age"] = "62"
mymap["Gender"] = "F"
mymap["ID"] = "6463246"
var wasAdded bool 
x, wasAdded = x.AddRowFromMap(mymap)
```

#### Set

Set second row (1) from a **slice**. The length of the slice must be the same as the number of columns and the row must already exist. If thereâ€™s an error `wasSet` is false.

```go
var wasSet bool
x, wasSet = x.SetRow(1, []string{"45", "F", "8356138"})
```

Set second row from **map**: If the map keys don't exist as columns, the value will be discarded. If a key does not exist, it will create empty cells.)

```go
mymap2 := make(map[string]string)
mymap2["Age"] = "62"
mymap2["Gender"] = "F"
mymap2["ID"] = "6463246"
var wasSet bool
x, wasSet = x.SetRowFromMap(1, mymap2)
```

#### Update

Unlike `SetRowFromMap`, `UpdateRowCellsFromMap` does not erase the cells value just because the column names are not keys in the  map. It updates the cells that have the column name in the map and maintains the value of all the others.

To update the age in row 1:

```go
mymap3 := make(map[string]string)
mymap3["Age"] = "63"
var wasUpdated bool
x, wasUpdated = x.UpdateRowCellsFromMap(1, mymap3)
```

#### Delete

Delete second row: (If the row number is invalid, `wasDeleted` is false)

```go
var wasDeleted bool
x, wasDeleted = x.DeleteRow(1)
```

### Column

#### Add

To add a column at the end of the CSV:

```go
var wasSucessful bool
x, wasSucessful = x.AddEmptyColumn("NewColumn")
```


### Cells

#### Get

Get value of the cell in the second column, second row:

```go
cellValue, cellExists := x.GetCell(1, 1)
```

Get the value of the cell in the column *Age*, second row:

```go
cellValue, cellExists := x.GetCellByField("Age", 1)
```

#### Set

Changes the value of the cell in the first column (0) and the second row (1) to "27":

```go
var wasChanged bool 
x, wasChanged = x.SetCell(0, 1, "27")
```

The same, using the column name instead of the column position:

```go 
var wasChanged bool 
x, wasChanged = x.SetCellByField("Age", 1, "27")
```
