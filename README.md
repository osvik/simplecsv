# Simplecsv

The **Go** package **simplecsv** is a simple mini-library to handle **csv** files. I'm building it to help me writing small command line scripts. Maybe it's useful to someone else as well.

**Some notes:**

* all **read** methods return the value in the csv and a second true/false value that is true if the value exists
* all **write** methods that change the csv return the changed csv and a true/false value if the operation was sucessful
* all cells are **strings**

## Examples

### Csv file

Simplecsv works with comma separated csv files.

#### Read

Reads file and parses as a SimpleCsv object. `fileRead` is false if there's an error reading the file or parsing the CSV.

```
var x simplecsv.SimpleCsv
x, fileRead = simplecsv.ReadCsvFile("my1file.csv")
```

#### Create

Create empty file and define cssv headers:

````
var u simplecsv.SimpleCsv
u = simplecsv.CreateEmpyCsv([]string{"Age", "Gender", "ID"})
```

#### Write

Write the SimpleCsv object to my2file.csv. If there's an error, `wasWritten` is false.

```
wasWritten := u.WriteCsvFile("my2file.csv")
```

### Headers

The cells of the first row are considered headers.

#### Get

Get all headers:

```
headers := x.GetHeaders()
```

Get header at position one (second position as it starts from 0):

```
headerName, headerExists := x.GetHeader(1)
```

Get header position: (it returns `-1` if the header does not exist)

```
position := x.GetHeaderPosition("Gender")
```

#### Rename

Rename header: (old header, new header)

```
x, headerExists := x.RenameHeader("ID", "IDnumber")
```

`headerExists` is false if the old header does not exist.

### Rows

#### Get

Get number of rows:

```
numberOfRows := x.GetNumberRows()
```

Get second row:

```
row, rowExists := x.GetRow(1)
```

Get second row as a map:

```
row, rowExists := x.GetRowAsMap(1)
```

#### Add

Add a **slice** to a row. The slice must have the same size as the CSV number of columns. If not wasSucessful is false.

```
x, wasSucessful = x.AddRow([]string{"24", "M", "2986732"})
```

Add row from **map**: (If the map keys don't exist as columns, the value will be discarded. If a key does not exist, it will create empty cells.)

```
mymap := make(map[string]string)
mymap["Age"] = "62"
mymap["Gender"] = "F"
mymap["ID"] = "6463246"
x, wasAdded = x.AddRowFromMap(mymap)
```

#### Set

Set second row (1) from a **slice**. The length of the slice must be the same as the number of columns and the row must already exist. If thereâ€™s an error `wasSet` is false.

```
x, wasSet = x.SetRow(1, []string{"45", "F", "8356138"})
```

Set second row from **map**: If the map keys don't exist as columns, the value will be discarded. If a key does not exist, it will create empty cells.)

```
mymap2 := make(map[string]string)
mymap2["Age"] = "62"
mymap2["Gender"] = "F"
mymap2["ID"] = "6463246"
x, wasAdded = x.SetRowFromMap(1, mymap2)
```

#### Delete

Delete second row: (If the row number is invalid, `wasDeleted` is false)

```
x, wasDeleted = x.DeleteRow(1)
```

### Cells

#### Get

Get value of the cell in the second column, second row:

```
cellValue, cellExists := x.GetCell(1, 1)
```

Get the value of the cell in the column *Age*, second row:

```
cellValue, cellExists := x.GetCellByField("Age", 1)
```

#### Set

Changes the value of the cell in the first column (0) and the second row (1) to "27":
```
x, wasChanged = x.SetCell(0, 1, "27")
```

The same, using the column name instead of the column position:

```
x, wasChanged = x.SetCellByField("Age", 1, "27")
```

## To do

* `UpdateRowCellsFromMap` - Like `SetRowFromMap` but maintaining old values when there's not a replacement value.
* `AddEmptyColumn` - Method to append an empty column to the csv
* Search and match methods
